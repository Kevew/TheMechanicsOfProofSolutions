### What is this repo?
This is my complete set of solutions to The Mechanics of Proof by Heather Macbeth. This is
not any official solution set but my own writing and opinions. 

You can checkout the book here: https://hrmacbeth.github.io/math2001/index.html

Note: My solutions do not use Heather's custom tactics. For example, I do not use "extra", "numbers", etc.
